**Turn your work into visibility — automatically.**

gitXflow is a full-stack platform that transforms developer achievements into **resume bullets, LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, and portfolio updates**, then **publishes them for you** via an async job queue.

> Build. Ship. Merge.  
> **gitXflow makes sure people see it.**

## ✨ What Problem Does This Solve?

Developers do meaningful work every day:
- Open-source contributions
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Feature launches

But that work often:
- Never makes it to Twitter
- Stays vague on resumes
- Goes unnoticed on LinkedIn
- Never gets documented consistently

**gitXflow fixes the visibility gap** by automatically turning real work into polished, platform-ready content — and posting it.

## 🧠 What gitXflow Does

1. **Connect GitHub**
   - Detects achievements from real activity (PRs, commits, repos)

2. **Generate Multi-Format Content (AI)**
   - Resume bullets (quantified, concise)
   - LinkedIn posts (professional narrative)
   - Twitter threads (3–5 tweets, optimized)

3. **Async Social Posting**
   - Post immediately or schedule for later
   - Database-backed job queue (no Redis, no BullMQ)
   - Vercel Cron processes jobs every minute

4. **Portfolio Sync**
   - Public portfolio page
   - Shows recent achievements and published tweets
